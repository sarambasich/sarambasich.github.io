# Vegan Options on Mackinac Island
Stefan Arambasich

2021-08

This is a guide to the various vegan options on Mackinac Islsand, MI. It was originally written in August 2021. I've updated it a little since. It's possible by now that things have changed and places have closed/stopped offering those options, but it's accurate as of that date. Your mileage may vary. This guide is worth how much you paid for it. ;)

This guide mostly covers places we did actually visit. There's a few that I've included towards the end that we did not visit but looked liked they had options.


## Food
### Seabiscuit Cafe

**Update**: it appears the black bean burger isn't served anymore. Check ahead.

We went here for dinner the first night. Seabiscuit is a smallish restaurant and pub with your typical bar fare. They have a black bean burger that is vegan (and so is the bun!). It was pretty decent. The fries that came with were reaaallly good! They also have a lot of good beer available. Our waitress was knowledgable about veganism, so they should be able to help.

### Watercolor Cafe

The Watercolor is a SUPER cute tucked-away cafe waterfront location on the more eastern side of Main St. This is a great breakfast spot. There's several options here. First, the coffee was really good. I got a mocha (which is vegan) and it was quite tasty. For food, I got avocado toast which is humbly seasoned with salt and pepper. I thought it was pretty good. The serving size is two slices of bread which is fairly generous. There are also several smoothie bowl options which can be made vegan (or may even be by default). They were also pretty good about vegan knowledge behind the counter.

### Amigo Burrito

This place is located inside the Murray Hotel lobby, but it is open to the public. This is where we stayed so it was super convenient; it was right downstairs for us. It's a Chipotle-style taco/burrito stand where you build your own dish. They have fajita veggies and the rice and bens are vegan. The burritos are made well though I felt some of the ingredients were mid. It needed a bit more flavor. Nevertheless, this is a good lunch spot that will fill you up 'til dinner.

### Millie's On Main

This is a slightly more upscale sit down restaurant with a large bar. They have a fried green bean appetizer which we enjoyed quite a bit (though I still am not 100% sure if they used egg or not...best to ask and verify). They also have a sweet potato-black bean burger which was REALLY GOOD. Unfortunately, the bun isn't vegan, and there aren't too many options that aren't salads besides this. Our waitress was understanding and did her best. I ended up getting the burger patty on top of a garden salad. Savanah got hers on top of the spinach salad. I'd definitely recommend the patty on the spinach salad as the garden salad has only iceberg lettuce. With the spinach salad, the burger is really delicious and filling. Just not a whole lot else here.

### Kingston Kitchen at the Village Inn

The Kingston Kitchen is a Jamacan/Caribbean restaurant where Jamacan natives prepare their native cuisines. Though the "V" symbols on the menu mean vegetarian (be careful!), there are a couple of vegan options including the jackfruit sandwich. This was really good, including the fries/potatoes. The sides are EXCELLENT! Honestly, it may be better to just get several sides and make that into your meal. Rice & beans, friend plantains, steamed veggies (which were seasoned excellently), and Jamaican bammy. Out of all of the above, I think this was the best overall meal we had. It's a bit more pricey but worth it for the much higher quality of the food. They also apparently have a vegan Belgian chocolate cheesecake for dessert, but I was too full to partake.


## Dessert / Treats
### Sadie’s Ice Cream
https://www.grandhotel.com/dining/sadies-ice-cream-parlor/

This is located within the building of the Grand Hotel (and I don't think you need to pay the $10 to just get ice cream here). They serve Hudsonville Ice cream. On the day we went, they only had one non-dairy/vegan option and that was vanilla ice cream. It was pretty good though! And apparently they may have other flavors. It must depend on their availability.

### Ryba's Fudge Shops
https://ryba.com

Vegan fudge!!! Need I say more? This is the only place on the island that serves vegan fudge - I don't think any of the other fudge shops do. Ryba's has a few shop locations around downtown, so I'm not sure if it matters which one you go to. But at the one we went to, our server pulled out a separate vegan fudge from the what was in the display case (unfortunately no free samples since it's pre-packaged). It's sold by weight but the sizes can vary from small-ish to quite big. The fudge itself is rich and chocolatey, with a slight grit to the texture. I enjoyed it!


## Other Places to Consider
We didn't go these places, but I added them to our vegan list just in case. You may wish to check them out, but I cannot personally vouch for what they have and don't have.

### Bistro on the Greens

This is located in the Mission Point resort. Apparently, they serve a Beyond Burger with vegan cheese. This resort looked pretty nice from the outside when we passed it, so it may be worth a visit.

### Winchester's
https://winchestersofmackinac.com

Whiskey bar with a cool vibe. We actually did go here, but only for drinks. I did notice a few options on the menu which looked like snacky-bar type fare, such as hummus and flatbread.


## Final Notes
Of course, Happy Cow has a few more spots that might be good to visit as well. https://www.happycow.net/north_america/usa/michigan/mackinac_island/
And there may also be more than what is listed there.

Mackinac Island is great, but the only unfortunate/sad part is the horses. Expect to see horses being ridden and pulling a dozen or more toursits about the island's streets. It's really great that there are no cars on the island (bring your bike or rent one), but it's just sad that we still have to have the animal exploitation. And of course, that means stinky poop so **BE CAREFUL** where you walk in the street! And plug your nose.

Have a great trip!
